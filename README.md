# bfCL
This is an experimental port of [TWLbf](https://github.com/Jimmy-Z/TWLbf) to OpenCL.

### Compile
Only tested with [mingw-w64-x86_64](https://mingw-w64.org/)
/[MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/)
(and occasionally Visual Studio 2017 Community) and Intel OpenCL SDK.

### License
AES and SHA1 code from [mbed TLS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/) which is Apache 2.0 license,
so I guess this project becomes Apache 2.0 licensed automatically?
or only related files are Apache 2.0? I'm not sure.
