# bfCL
OpenCL! fancy!

Only tested with mingw-w64-x86_64/MSYS2 and Intel OpenCL SDK,
should work with MSVC(not too old) and POSIX with other OpenCL SDK.

Used code from [mbed TLS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/) which is Apache 2.0 license,
so I guess this project becomes Apache 2.0 licensed automatically?
or only the related file are Apache 2.0? I'm not sure.
